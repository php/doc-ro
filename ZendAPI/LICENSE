OPEN PUBLICATION LICENSE

I. REQUIREMENTS ON BOTH UNMODIFIED AND MODIFIED VERSIONS

The Open Publication works may be reproduced and distributed in whole or
in part, in any medium physical or electronic, provided that the terms of
this license are adhered to, and that this license or an incorporation of
it by reference (with any options elected by the author(s) and/or
publisher) is displayed in the reproduction.

Proper form for an incorporation by reference is as follows:

Copyright (c) 2000 by Zend Technologies, Ltd.  This material may be
distributed only subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Open
Publication License, v1.0 or later (the latest version is presently
available at http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/).

The reference must be immediately followed with the following terms: 

A.  Distribution of substantively modified versions of this document is
prohibited without the explicit permission of the copyright holder.  
"Substantive modification" is defined as a change to the content of the
document, and excludes mere changes in format or typographical
corrections.

B.  Commercial distribution of the work or derivative of the work in any
standard (paper) book form is prohibited unless prior permission is
obtained from the copyright holder.

Other than as otherwise set forth herein, commercial redistribution of
Open Publication-licensed material is permitted.

Any publication in standard (paper) book form shall require the citation
of the original publisher and author. The publisher and author's names
shall appear on all outer surfaces of the book. On all outer surfaces of
the book the original publisher's name shall be as large as the title of
the work and cited as possessive with respect to the title.

II. COPYRIGHT

The copyright to each Open Publication is owned by its author(s) or
designee.

III. SCOPE OF LICENSE

The following license terms apply to all Open Publication works, unless
otherwise explicitly stated in the document.

Mere aggregation of Open Publication works or a portion of an Open
Publication work with other works or programs on the same media shall not
cause this license to apply to those other works. The aggregate work shall
contain a notice specifying the inclusion of the Open Publication material
and appropriate copyright notice.

SEVERABILITY. If any part of this license is found to be unenforceable in
any jurisdiction, the remaining portions of the license remain in force.

NO WARRANTY. Open Publication works are licensed and provided "as is"
without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
particular purpose or a warranty of non-infringement.

IV. REQUIREMENTS ON MODIFIED WORKS

All modified versions of documents covered by this license, including
translations, anthologies, compilations and partial documents, must meet
the following requirements:

1) The modified version must be labeled as such.
2) The person making the modifications must be identified and the
modifications dated.
3) Acknowledgement of the original author and publisher if applicable must
be retained according to normal academic citation practices.
4) The location of the original unmodified document must be identified.
5) The original author's (or authors') name(s) may not be used to assert
or imply endorsement of the resulting document without the original
author's (or authors') permission.

V. GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS 

In addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from and
strongly recommended of redistributors that:

1) If you are distributing Open Publication works on hardcopy or CD-ROM,
you provide email notification to the authors of your intent to
redistribute at least thirty days before your manuscript or media freeze,
to give the authors time to provide updated documents. This notification
should describe modifications, if any, made to the document.

2) All substantive modifications (including deletions) be either clearly
marked up in the document or else described in an attachment to the
document.

Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is considered
good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and CD-ROM expression of an
Open Publication-licensed work to its author(s).

VI. ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS

A. Distribution of "substantively modified" versions of this document is
prohibited without the explicit permission of the copyright holder.  
"Substantive modification" is defined as a change to the content of the
document, and excludes mere changes in format or typographical
corrections.

B. Commercial distribution of the work or derivative of the work in any
standard (paper) book form is prohibited unless prior permission is
obtained from the copyright holder.
